# Best Ball Website
This project is a prototype for a website selling baseballs.
It was build in repl.it (https://replit.com/@Asvo21/Best-Ball-Online-Shop) and I wanted to publish it here.
This project is the first website I made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I created it as my final project for a robotics course. Although it was completed at the end of 2022, there's still a lot to do, especially on the payment page. But I preferred to work on other projects.
